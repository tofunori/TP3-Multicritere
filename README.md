This script is designed for use in R. Through a multi-criteria analysis involving multiple rasters and shapefiles, such as canopy height, slope, roads, etc., you will be able to calculate the potential for forest logging.
You can use your own files. However, it is important to ensure that all files have the same extent and projection to guarantee that everything works correctly.
So first change the path of your files and might be better to setup tehm in your working directory.
Have fun!
